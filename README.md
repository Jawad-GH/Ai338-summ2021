2. A short description of what we did?

ANSWER:

We have done a Python code (juypter lab) and did Split Training Data for Cross-validation for both 'test' and 'train' files which were given
first we imported libraries on python then started coding by uploading test.csv and train.csv file then we scatter file by using matplotlib library
then initialize values in 'X' and 'Y' then checked its lenght, we also used 'from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression' library to cross validate
dataset properly and in the last just check our score.

3. What insights you gained from this assignment?

ANSWER:

If we have huge amount of dataset we can split that data into some ratio i.e 80%, 20% or 70%, 10%, 10%
and can find an accurate result after shuffling these type of cross validation use in different companies or industries
which have some huge amount of datasets.

CODE:
I Have submitted an .ipynb (code file) in the as03 Folder, Kindly Check it thanks!
